This bank app enables users to deposit, withdraw, and check current balance in real time. 

In addition, this bank app is to further support extra additional features such as pin number changes, access balance statements and so on.

Once the main function is executed, it prompts the user to insert the credit/debit card information (physical insertion or typing its numbers).

Then, the user is required to take actions among eight options as follows:

1. See Balance  

2. Deposit 

3. Withdraw

4. Transfer

5. PIN number changes  

6. Mini Statement 

7. Utility Bill Payment 

8. Other Services

Currently, only See Balance, Deposit, and Withdraw functions are supported.
