[Overview]

This bank app enables users to deposit their finance, withdraw them, and check current balance in real time. 

In addition, this bank app is to further support extra additional features such as pin number changes, access balance statements and so on downstream.

Once the main function is executed, it prompts the user to choose a specific action to trigger its defined behaviors.

Then, the user is required to take actions among eight options as follows:

1. See Balance  

2. Deposit 

3. Withdraw

4. Transfer

5. PIN number changes  

6. Mini Statement 

7. Utility Bill Payment 

8. Other Services

Currently, only "See Balance, Deposit, and Withdraw functions" are supported, and the rest of functions are currently in development.
